      <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>First TRC was introduced in IR in 1963 having features of recording of gauge, unevenness, cross level and twist by mechanical sensors with analogue output.</li>
      <li>Electronic TRC with mechanical sensors and electronic LVDT was introduced in 1975,. In 1978 TRRC was introduced with non-contact type capacitive sensors which had the facility of storage on magnetic media.</li>
      <li>This TRRC had a speed potential of 20-120 kmph, along with measurement of alignment and vehicle ride parameters, whereas earlier TRCs had speed potentials of 60-80 kmph only. First microprocessor based TRC with an inertial system of measurement was introduced in 1985 with the facility of categorization of Track in A,B,C and D category.</li>
      <li>In the TRC introduced in 1992, feature of synchronization of TRC with ground features was made for the first time. In 2007 the first windows based TRC was introduced with additional features of simultaneous recording and processing of data along with better user interface.</li>
      <li>In 2014 first Laser contact less sensor based TRCs were introduced with IMU having facility of recordingÂ halfÂ rail</li>

      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>Indian Railways faces challenges in real-time track monitoring due to dependency on manual inspections. 
      This project introduces an indigenous, contactless, integrated monitoring system designed to record track 
      conditions efficiently and enhance passenger safety.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Indian Railways has one of the largest rail networks in the world. Safe train operations heavily depend on continuous monitoring and maintenance of tracks. At present, much of the monitoring is done using manual inspections and imported technologies that require periodic halts, direct contact with the track, or expensive specialized rolling stock. These approaches are costly, time-consuming, and not always feasible for continuous large-scale monitoring.</li>
        <li>There is a pressing need to develop an indigenous, cost-effective, and contactless integrated track monitoring system that can provide real-time data on track health without disturbing normal trainÂ operations.</li>

      <h2>System Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contactless Measurement: Utilizes laser sensors and high-speed cameras to measure track parameters like gauge, cant, alignment, and rail wear without physical contact. </li>
        <li>Integrated Subsystems: Consists of various subsystems, including track geometry measurement, track component inspection, rail profile and wear measurement, and acceleration measurement. </li>
        <li>Real-time Data Processing: Includes edge servers on the vehicle for real-time data processing and sophisticated data analytics to interpret track conditions. </li>
        <li>Instant Communication: Generates real-time alerts for critical defects via SMS and email to relevant personnel, facilitating swift responses. </li>
        <li>Track Management System Integration: Seamlessly integrated with the Railways' existing Track Management System (TMS) for efficient data relay and analysis. </li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Phased Rollout: The system was introduced during fiscal years 2022-23 and 2023-24, with initial deployment of three operational units. </li>
        <li>Expanded Fleet: The plan includes expanding the fleet to seven units, with the goal of monitoring 2.54 lakh kilometers of track by 2024-25. A total investment of approximately Rs 180 crore is planned to deploy ITMS across all 17 railway zones. </li>
        <li>Long-Term Support: The supplier is responsible for the maintenance and operation of these systems for a period of seven years, ensuring long-term reliability and continuous technologicalÂ upgrades</li>
